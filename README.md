- Run ```node prod.js```
- You're ready to go!

## Developping

You're are encouraged to submit PR and to participate to the development of
the app.

If you're working on the code, we have a special setup: run ```node dev.js```.
It will watch for changes into the code and will restart the server on every
changes.

We do not have particular guidelines excepted that you're code must be right.
Also, you have to use tabs and be aligned on existing code.

Thank you!
